flag as red things that are past today
---
infer a status ... next is things that are today, deferred is things that are after today
show this on the search screen and the board
---
show only next on the board ... if nothing in next then show deferred
---
use ^ for status and something else for date, maybe @, maybe nothing, maybe the date is part of the status
---
query sort order is all wrong
---
have a max items setting, default to 10 and then do ... to encourage faster processing
---
show a summary of stats - using the colours and counts
---
moan if something is next and it is nexted again (don't change the date, enforce a defer)
---
make defer better
---
support ; when adding (how do we handle tags? apply to all?)
---
: tag (although search covers it for now)
---
will want expert mode add and next +/
will want expert mode add and defer +/w etc
will want expert mode add and done +!
might want expert mode / d, / w, / m, / y where it's automatically 1, but could be / d 2 etc

(unsorted)
red for things that are past due date
orange for collected
yellow for next
grey for things we don't need to worry about yet (incubated backlog) i.e. someday maybe
how about delegated - maybe they should be highlighted blue or yellow/orange - could also have a due date
 - important to highlight what we are waiting on
do we allow reference items? - could also be grey
