(unsorted)
red for things that are past due date
orange for collected
yellow for next
grey for things we don't need to worry about yet (incubated backlog) i.e. someday maybe
how about delegated - maybe they should be highlighted blue or yellow/orange - could also have a due date
 - important to highlight what we are waiting on
do we allow reference items? - could also be grey
