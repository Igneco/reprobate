---
only show collected (= blue) until there are none
---
show a breakdown of stats - using the colours and counts
---
defer
---
support ; when adding (how do we handle tags? apply to all?)
---
maybe this should be gtd afterall - yes it's too close to rim otherwise
---
the colours seem wonky for some reason, probably thing.render
---
use the colour system like rim (or opposite)
---
show only collected if there are some
---
ref : tag ...
---
will want add and next - presumably / is next actually and ! is done
---
undo will automatically go back to being dated
---
(unsorted)
red for things that are past due date
orange for collected
yellow for next
grey for things we don't need to worry about yet (incubated backlog)
magenta for done
how about delegated - maybe they should be highlighted blue or yellow/orange - could also have a due date
 - important to highlight what we are waiting on

have option to decide how many items to show, default to 1 or 5

---
aka might come back at some point
---
is this really just rim with a single status and no releases?
---
make collected be blue = cold, grey = someday maybe
