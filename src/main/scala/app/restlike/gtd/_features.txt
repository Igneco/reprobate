we really need +/1w etc ... hmmm (maybe they should always be 3 chars long)
---
support do and remind in 1w, 1m, 1y etc - e.g. invoices and bills
---
might need to make things overdue ... although its a but iffy obv
---
expert mode, when adding split on a char that isnt ';,|'
---
order ? by status colour
---
we really need +!
---
make it impossible to process next until collected are all done (later make it an option)
---
query sort order is all wrong
---
have a max items setting, default to 10 and then do ... to encourage faster processing
---
moan if something is next and it is nexted again (don't change the date, enforce a defer)
---
make defer even betterer
---
support ; when adding (how do we handle tags? apply to all?)
---
: tag (although search covers it for now)
---
will want expert mode add and defer +/w etc
will want expert mode add and done +!
might want expert mode / d, / w, / m, / y where it's automatically 1, but could be / d 2 etc

(unsorted)
red for things that are past due date
orange for collected
yellow for next
grey for things we don't need to worry about yet (incubated backlog) i.e. someday maybe
how about delegated - maybe they should be highlighted blue or yellow/orange - could also have a due date
 - important to highlight what we are waiting on
do we allow reference items? - could also be grey

how about: red really overdue, orange a bit overdue, yellow due, grey deferred
