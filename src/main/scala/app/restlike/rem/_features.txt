//TODO: Next
//update key
//update value
//tag
//detag
//other standard tagging stuff
//stop using white .. it won't play well on white backgrounds - could have an inverse user setting?

//TODO: Then
//store things per user (think about globlal id vs user id)
//tidy up everything about status, ownership and releases

//TODO: could it be more about creating entities and add KV pairs to them
//TODO: implement slack style tokens

//TODO: de-dupe
//pull out a clitools jar
//can we share serialisers and persistence? (put in common) .. might be hard

//TODO: rem should not need aka
//... but it probably needs something other than just the token
//base64/salted username perhaps (done as part of install script)
//https://github.com/Nycto/Hasher

//how to do the auth - from dorin
//(1) wget rim register foo@bar.com
//(2) sends email
//(3) user opens email and validates address
//(4) just use uuid to generate the token
//(5) for resets just repeat it
//(6) use liftmetamapper maybe (or lift dcs email stuff)

---------------------------------
