package app.restlike.rem

//name:
//ref or something to do with facts

//should rec be the same or a different thing?

//TODO: Next
//update key _=
//update value =_
(or reverse) _ suggests leave whats there already
//tag
//detag
//other standard tagging stuff
//stop using white .. it won't play well on white backgrounds - could have an inverse user setting?
//check for dupe keys
//are dupe values okay?
//on 'rem [ref] -' re-show list (how to order it?)
//on 'rem [ref] +' re-show the list with added highlighted (how to order it?)
//work on colours - it's good that values are different from keys but more subtle

//TODO: Then
//store things per user (think about globlal id vs user id)
//tidy up everything about status, ownership and releases

//TODO: could it be more about creating entities and add KV pairs to them
//TODO: implement slack style tokens

//TODO: de-dupe
//pull out a clitools jar
//can we share serialisers and persistence? (put in common) .. might be hard

//... but it probably needs something other than just the token
//base64/salted username perhaps (done as part of install script)

//from original list:

//this is the first project to move to aws
/////////////////////////////////
//how to do the auth - from dorin
//(1) wget spabloshi.com/rim/register foo@bar.com
//(2) sends email
//(3) user opens email and validates address
//(4) just use uuid to generate the token
//(5) for resets just repeat it
//(6) use liftmetamapper maybe (or lift dcs email stuff)
//(7) don't invalidate existing token until new token request has been validated - otherwise it could be uses to deny people
//need to store if token has been validated
//(8) S3 backup
/////////////////////////////////

//for email: http://aws.amazon.com/ses/
//will presumably want only one token for all ... certainly rem and rdo .. probably not rim
