maybe this should be gtd afterall

use the colour system like rim (or opposite)

red for things that are past due date
orange for collected
yellow for next
grey for things we don't need to worry about yet (incubated backlog)
magenta for done
how about delegated - maybe they should be highlighted blue or yellow/orange - could also have a due date
 - important to highlight what we are waiting on

have option to decide how many items to show, default to 1 or 5
